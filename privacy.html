      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p>Last updated: <strong>November 28, 2025</strong></p>

      <h2>1. Overview</h2>
      <p>
        TokFlow Scheduler (“we”, “us”, or “our”) is a personal web application
        used to plan and schedule TikTok posts. This Privacy Policy explains
        how we handle information when you use the service.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Information we collect</h2>
      <p>When you authorize TokFlow Scheduler with TikTok, we may receive:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Your TikTok user ID and basic profile information.</li>
        <li>Access tokens provided by TikTok to interact with your account.</li>
        <li>Metadata about videos you upload through the app (caption text,
          scheduled time, status, and internal identifiers).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We do <strong>not</strong> collect your TikTok password and do not
        attempt to access your account by any method other than TikTok’s
        official OAuth flow.
      </p>

      <h2>3. How we use information</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>To schedule and publish videos to your TikTok account at your
          request.</li>
        <li>To show you a list of your scheduled or past posts.</li>
        <li>To maintain the security and reliability of the service.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>4. Data storage and retention</h2>
      <p>
        We store only the minimum necessary data to provide the scheduling
        functionality. Drafts, captions, and schedule times may be stored in
        our database until you delete them or they are automatically cleaned
        up after a retention period.
      </p>
      <p>
        Access tokens from TikTok are stored securely and used only to perform
        actions that you initiate through the app.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Sharing of information</h2>
      <p>
        We do not sell, rent, or trade your personal information. We may share
        data only when required by law or to protect our rights or the safety
        of others.
      </p>

      <h2>6. Use of TikTok APIs</h2>
      <p>
        TokFlow Scheduler uses TikTok’s official APIs and is designed to
        comply with TikTok’s Terms of Service and Developer Policies. The app
        does not provide features for fake engagement, follower manipulation,
        or bulk automation of multiple unrelated accounts.
      </p>

      <h2>7. Your choices</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>You can stop using the service at any time.</li>
        <li>
          You can revoke TokFlow Scheduler’s access in your TikTok account
          settings.
        </li>
        <li>
          You may request deletion of stored data by contacting us at the
          email listed on the <a href="contact.html">Contact</a> page.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>8. Security</h2>
      <p>
        We use reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect the
        information we store. However, no method of transmission or storage is
        completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.
      </p>

      <h2>9. Children</h2>
      <p>
        TokFlow Scheduler is intended for adults and is not directed to
        children under 13. We do not knowingly collect information from
        children under 13.
      </p>

      <h2>10. Changes to this policy</h2>
      <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we
        will update the “Last updated” date at the top of this page.
      </p>
